# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

AutosRUsâ€™ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles. By running regression analyses and t-tests, I will review production data for AutoRU's newest prototype, the MechaCar, and provide insights that may help the manufacturing team. Additionally, I will design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
