# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

AutosRUsâ€™ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles. By running regression analyses and t-tests, I will review production data for AutoRU's newest prototype, the MechaCar, and provide insights that may help the manufacturing team. Additionally, I will design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Deliverable_One_LM.PNG](https://github.com/dwwatson1/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/Deliverable_One_LM.PNG)

The linear regression model above estimates that: 

```mpg = (6.267)vehicle_length + (0.0012)vehicle_weight + (0.0688)spoiler_angle + (3.546)ground_clearance + (-3.411)AWD - 104.0```

* Using the formula above, vehicle length, and ground clearance are statistically likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the model or are most likely to affect the miiles per gallon performance of the MechaCar's AutosRUs prototype.  
* Given the model's ```p-value of 5.35e-11```, which is lower than the 0.05 assumed statistical significance, there is strong evidence **against the null hypothesis** (slope = 0). Therefore, we can accept that alternative hypothesis that the **slope is not 0**.
* The model's ```r-squared value of .7149``` means that about 71% of the variance in mpg predictions can be explained by this model, while 29% cannot. In other words, the variables of vehicle length, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD have a stong positive association with mpg. Therefore, this model effectively predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Looking at the PSI data for all three manufacturing lots, provided in the PSI summary chart below, we see that the ```variance of the suspension coils is 62.69 pounds per square inch```. Therefore, it does not exceed the design specification of 100 pounds per square inch.

When we break the manufacturing data by the three lots, shown below, we see that on the one hand Lot 1 and 2 have ```variances of 0.98 and 7.47``` that are well below the design specification of 100 pounds per square inch. On the other hand, Lot 3, has a much larger ```variance of 170.29``` that are well above the design specification. The variance of Lot 3 is causing the PSI variance of the total lot population to increase significantly.

The box plot below demonstrates how much larger the variance of Lot 3 is compared to Lot 1 and 2.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

* summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

Next, we needed to conduct a t-test to determine if the PSI across all manufacturing lots is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch and then t-tests for each manufacturing lots.

The first t-test was used to determine if the PSI across all manufacturing lots is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. The result of the t-test showed that there was a ```sample mean of 1,498.78``` and a ```p-value of 0.06```. Because our p-value is higher than the assumed statistical significance of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that the PSI across all manufacturing lots is **statistically similar** to the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

The next three t-tests were used to determine if the PSI across each individual manufacturing lot is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

* Lot 1 results show that the ```sample mean is 1,500``` and the p-value is a perfect 1. There is no statistical difference from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. In this case, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
* Lot 2 results show ```sample mean is 1,500.02``` and the ```p-value is 0.61```. Because the p-value is much higher than the assumed statistical significance of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no statistical difference from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.
* Lot 3 results show ```sample mean is 1,496.14``` and the ```p-value is 0.04```. Because the p-value is lower than the assumed statistical significance of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that the true mean is not equal to 1,500. This means that this sample shows that there is statistical difference from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

* Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
* What metric or metrics are you going to test?
* What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
* What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
* What data is needed to run the statistical test?
